# I will be looking at data from the ride share company Divvy. Divvy is a bike and rental company with kiosks set up all over major cities. They have provided a years worth of bike rental data from rides all around Chicago. I am hoping by exploring this data I will be able to garner insights to help Divvy decide how to best move forward.
# After looking at the data, I decided to get rid of null values. These all stemmed from incomplete data, typically with missing end times or ending locations. I decided it was better to drop the nulls since I don't know what caused the missing data and couldn't trust those particular rides to be correct.
# I added new fields to better analyze and graph the data mainly centered around datetime information and fields calculating ride times.
